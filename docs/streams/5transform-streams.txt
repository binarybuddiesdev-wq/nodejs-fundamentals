TRANSFORM STREAM

-> a stream that reads the data, changes it and send the modified data chunk by chunk.


Mental Model picture

Input Stream
   ↓
[ TRANSFORM ]
   ↓
Output Stream


-> unlike duplex where the read and write are independent but here the output depends on the input.


use cases

-> Compressing files (gzip)
-> Encrypting / decrypting data
-> Converting JSON → CSV
-> Upper casing / sanitizing logs
-> Streaming validation
-> Modifying HTTP responses



-> _flush() is called once, when the input stream has no more data, to let you handle any remaining incomplete data.
