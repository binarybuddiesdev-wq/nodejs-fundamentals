STREAM

A Stream is a way to process data piece by piece instead of loading the entire data at once into memory.

useCase EX:

let's say we need to read a file which is of 2gb 

in this case without streams

node tries to load the entire file into the ram
memory usage spikes
the app may slow down or get crashed


with streams

file is read in small chunks
each chunk is processed immediately
memory usage is low
fast and scalable


overall the streams are about 

performance
memory efficiency
handling large or continuous data.



---> Streams let us start working with data before all of it is available.



where are streams used


1) File Handling

-> read and write files.
-> video/audio files.

ex: downloading a file, uploading a file, copying files exc



2) Network & HTTP

-> Incoming HTTP Requests
-> Sending responses chunk by chunk


ex: 
-> API receiving a large JSON body
-> Sending a video file to the browser
-> Live data (chat, notifications)

req and res in Express are streams.




3) Data processing

-> Compressing files
-> Encrypting/decrypting data
-> Parsing CSV / JSON line by line


ex: Read file → compress → save (without loading whole file)



4) Real-time systems

-> Video streaming
-> Audio streaming
-> Logs
-> WebSockets





They are 4 Different Types of Streams 

1) Readable – data flows from a source to your app
2) Writable – data flows from your app to a destination
3) Duplex – data flows both ways (read + write)
4) Transform – data is read, modified, then written
