Readable Stream


-> A Readable Stream is a stream from which your program reads data chunk by chunk.
-> Data comes into your program.


real world useCases of Readable Streams

-> Reading a file
-> Incoming HTTP request
-> Reading data from a socket
-> Reading stdin (keyboard input)

Examples:
-> Reading a big .txt or .log file
-> Receiving file upload from frontend
-> Streaming a video file



Events & Methods

-> A Readable Stream talks with us using events & we can control it using methods.




Events


There are 4 Different Events available


1) data

-> when ever a chunk of data is available, the event is fired/triggered.
-> can be triggered multiple times, each time gives us a chunk of data.




2) end

-> triggers when there is no more data left.
-> triggered only once and always come at the end/last.



3) error

-> if something goes wrong then error event will be triggered.
ex: 

-> File not found
-> Permission denied
-> Stream closed unexpectedly



4) close 

-> it fires/triggers when the stream is fully closed.
-> it can be either after end event or after error event.










METHODS


-> these are the actions which we can perform according to the events triggered



1) .read()

-> Manually reads data from the stream
-> Mostly used in paused mode



2) .pause()

-> stops emitting data events.
-> Data flow temporarily stops



3) .resume()

-> Restarts data flow after pause
-> data event continuous




4) .pipe(destination)


-> Connects readable stream to writable stream
-> what ever we are reading is automatically written in a place where ever we want.



5) .unpipe()

-> Disconnects a piped destination





dummy file for reading the data is present in the utils-testing/streams folder 
we can run the python file which is generate_big_file.py using the command python generate_big_file.py
which generates some huge dummy content which can be used for readable stream and we can increase the no of records if we want
